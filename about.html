        <h2>about me!</h2><br>
        <p>I come from a family that really values education. Both of my parents have PhD's, my older sister was awarded summa cum lade for her outstanding work throughout college, and my brother is a D.O. currently in the middle of a pediatric residency. Being the youngest of my family, I have the most amazing role models I could have ever asked for. My family is always very proud of me and know that I work really hard to achieve my goals.
          <br><br>
          Being from Colorado and staying in Colorado for college, I really enjoy being outside as much as possible soaking up the Colorado sunshine. When it's warm outside, I enjoy hiking, biking, and relaxing in the sun; however, when it's cold outside, I prefer to stay inside which shocks a lot of people that I grew up in Colorado but never learned to ski or snowboard.   <br><br>
