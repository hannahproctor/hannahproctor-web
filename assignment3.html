       <h1>American Cheese</h1><hr>
       <p> Modern American cheese is a type of processed cheese developed in the 1910s made from cheddar, colby, or similar cheeses. It is mild with a creamy and salty flavor, has a medium-firm consistency, and has a low melting point. It is typically yellow or white in color; yellow American cheese is seasoned and colored with annatto. </p>

    <h2 id="history-section"><em>History</em></h2><hr>
    <p> British colonists made <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheddar_cheese">cheddar cheese</a> soon after their arrival in North America. By 1790, American-made cheddars were being exported back to England. According to Robert Carlton Brown, author of The Complete Book of Cheese, what was known in America as yellow cheese or store cheese was known as American cheddar or Yankee cheddar back in England. The Oxford English Dictionary lists the first known usage of "American cheese" as occurring in the Frankfort, Kentucky, newspaper The Guardian of Freedom in 1804.

    <h2 id="market-size"><em>Market Size</em></h2><hr>
    <p> Americans purchased about $2.77 billion worth of American cheese in 2018, but the popularity was falling, and, according to Bloomberg News, sales were projected to drop 1.6% in 2018. The average price for a pound of American cheese was below $4 ($8.82/kg) for the first time since 2011.

    <h2 id="legal-definition"><em>Legal Definition</em></h2><hr>
    <p> According to the Standards of Identity for Dairy Products, part of the U.S. Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), to be labeled "American cheese" a processed cheese is required to be manufactured from cheddar cheese, colby cheese, washed curd cheese, or granular cheese, or any mixture of two or more of these. The CFR also includes regulations for the manufacturing of processed American cheese.</p>
    <p>Because its manufacturing process differs from traditional cheeses,federal laws mandate that it be labeled as "process American cheese" if made from combining more than one cheese or "process American cheese food" if it contains at least 51% cheese but other specific dairy ingredients such as cream, milk, skim milk, buttermilk, cheese whey, or albumin from cheese whey are added. Products that have other added ingredients, such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraft_Foods">Kraft</a> Singles that contain milk protein concentrate, use legally unregulated terms such as "pasteurized prepared cheese product".</p>

    <h2 id="manufacturing-process"><em>Manufacturing Process</em></h2><hr>
    <p>Traditional cheese is ground, combined with emulsifying agents and other ingredients, mixed and heated until it forms a "melted homogeneous" mixture. To pasteurize it, the cheese mixture must be heated to a temperature of at least 150 °F (66 °C) for a minimum of 30 seconds.</p>

    <p>Composition requirements of processed American cheese control the percentage of milkfat, moisture, salt and pH value in the final product, along with specifications for flavor, body and texture, color, and meltability. Processed American cheese is packaged in individually wrapped slices, as unwrapped slices sold in stacks, or in unsliced blocks. Individually wrapped slices are formed from processed cheese which solidifies only between the wrapping medium; these slices, sold as 'singles', are typically the least like traditional cheese. Blocks of American cheese are more similar to traditional cheese, and are sliced to order at deli counters.</p>

    <h2 id="other-sandwich-toppings"><em>Other Sandwich Toppings</em></h2><hr>
    <p> A sandwich is a food typically consisting of vegetables, sliced cheese or meat, placed on or between slices of bread, or more generally any dish wherein bread serves as a container or wrapper for another food type. Cheese can be used in many different ways but one of the most popular ways is on a sandwich alongside other meats and toppings. Personally, I enjoy sandwiches with <a href="https://aidancjones.github.io/assignment3.html">Avocado</a>, <a href="https://caitlinmullenix.github.io/assignment3.html">Pickles</a> and cheese on them. </p>
