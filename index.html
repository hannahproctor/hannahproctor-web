      <p> Hi! My name is Hannah Proctor (she/her) and I am a senior at CU Boulder! I am majoring in Business Administration with an emphasis in Marketing and Real Estate as well as getting a minor in Creative Technological Design.
      <p> I have a 1 year old Rottweiler named Dahmer (yes, he is named after Jeffrey Dahmer the serial killer) and he is the biggest sweetheart ever.
      <p> In this course, I hope to gain a better understanding of HTML and how I will be able to use it throughout my future career.
